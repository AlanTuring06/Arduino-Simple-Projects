# Arduino Simple Projects

Welcome to the **Arduino Simple Projects** repository! This project serves as a collection of simple Arduino projects that I am learning from the [Learn Arduino with Paul McWhorter](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD6aF8f0M6GfYZn6udcWgHbVUV3PrrKGo) playlist. Each project will include a brief explanation, code snippets, and insights into the learning process.

## Introduction

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It allows users to create interactive electronic projects. This repository aims to document my journey through various simple projects, enhancing my understanding of Arduino programming and electronics.

## Project List

1. **Project 1: Use Pushbutton as a Toggle Switch**
   - Description: A simple project to use pushbutton as a toggle switch and turn the LED on/off.
   - Files: [Project 1.md](./Project%201.md)

2. **Project 2: Temperature and Humidity LED Display**
   - Description: A simple project using LED display to show the temperature and humidity.
   - Files: [Project 2.md](./Project%202.md)

## Getting Started

To get started with Arduino, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Arduino IDE**: Download and install the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. **Set Up Your Hardware**: Ensure you have the necessary hardware components for each project (e.g., Arduino board, sensors, LEDs).
